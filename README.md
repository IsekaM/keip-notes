# Keip - Simple Local Storage Notes App
[Check It Out](https://keip.makesimorrison.ml) 👀

As the name states, this app is just a simple note taking app, made with *HTML, CSS and good old Javascript*. I got inspiration from the Google Keep or Keep Notes desktop app for the design as well as the general idea as it is something I use often throughout the week.

As a starter project, I didn't want to make just a plain old todo list app. That's for chumps (no offense to all the chumps out there 👍). I wanted to make something a bit more complex that took way more brainpower and a lot more Duckduckgo-ing to make. So I made this masterpiece.

## Features
I know what you're thinking after you've read the last sentence, what did this "one level above a chump" put in this app to earn him a promotion. Well, I added the ability to add notes, delete notes (coming soon 😅), edit notes that have already been added, put notes in different section (favourites, archived, trash (again...coming soon) and a plain notes section) and add them to localstorage so the won't be gone when you refresh. 

## Future Plans For Keip
First and foremost, a name change (if I can think of one). I also want to add the ability to change note colors. The biggest thing I hope to do is make this a full CRUD application with cloud storage so notes won't every go away...unless I get hacked or something 😪. Wish me luck 😁.

**More Updates Coming Soon ✌**
